# Neovim Config

This is a simple neovim config I cobbled together from various sources.
It started out using [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) as the package manager, however, since Packer is deprecated, I've made the switch to [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

I plan on adding features as I go.

## Instructions

## Mac
By default, Neovim looks for a folder called _nvim_ in the .config folder. 
To install this config, clone the repo into your .config folder

The repo will be named `neovim-lua`. 
Rename it to `nvim`.

Lazy will automatically download and install any plugins.

## Windows
Instructions pending. I primarily code on Mac at the moment, but do plan on getting a Windows config put together once I upgrade my gaming rig to Windows 11 Pro.
