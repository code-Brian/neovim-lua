# Neovim Config

This is a simple neovim config I cobbled together from various sources.

Package Manager: [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).

I plan on adding features as I go.

## Installation Instructions

## Mac
Clone this repo to your `.config` folder.

The repo will be named `neovim-lua`. 
Rename it to `nvim`.

Lazy will automatically download and install any plugins.

## Windows
Clone this repo to your `$userProfile$\AppData\Local` folder.
